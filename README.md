Usage:

      1:make

      2:open matlab and execute lf_script

Requirement:

	  1:the data is simulated while running lf_script.m

	  2:Be careful to check all the paths in the makefile is correct(especially matlab root)

	  3:directly tune parameters by editing lf_script.m and LFlasso

	  4:You can test different parallel programming settings in w_solver.cpp

Info:

      1:Another MKL version is still on working

      2:LFlasso_over use dense A maxcut solver
